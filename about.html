<p>I'm always fighting between the creative and the logical cognitive processes. It amazes me that an idea that comes seemingly out of nowhere in a moment of creative passion can outweigh a conclusion I've come to after hours of logical problem-solving. Sometimes all I have is logic, and the creative inspirations are nowhere to be found. As a musician, performer, and teacher, I use an intuitive creative processes to design projects and engage with others, but as an audio engineer, carpenter, former civil engineering student, and now a programming student, I also have to use logic and reasoning skills to solve problems and execute my designs. This blog is about crossing over; using creative processes for the logical work in my life and using analytical processes for the creative work, and tracking how my skills can improve when I do both. </p>
