I notice a shift in my thinking now that I'm working through new material after having completed my first portfolio project. As much as I missed the gratification from completing readmes and smaller labs and "turning lights green" in my curriculum tab, the (week +) it took me to grapple with the CLI Gem project gave me an entirely different prospective on **how** we're learning within this program. You learn to appreciate the file structure of the labs FlatIron gives you instead of being overwhelmed when a new type of file is introduced. You garner a deeper understanding for how Object Oriented setup files can help streamline the lesson you are learning (I know I can focus better on what I'm being taught when I can see all of the levers and pulleys being the curtain). And your relationship goes from HATE to LOVE for rspec tests once you have to build something from scratch with no parameters whatsoever. It's that shift in thinking that has me so excited to continue moving forward into the first unit within the Sinatra section.

Maybe it's due to this shift in thinking, but for one reason or another, I found spending time writing queries in SQL to find specific peices of information in database tables super fun! They remind me of logic puzzles that take a nice amount of creative thinking without getting frustrating. The semantics of the language are very clear and create a strong mental picture. I can see the tables collaborating very clearly, while OO Ruby collaborating objects took a very long time to **visualize** how the objects are collobarting, and I feel that my understanding of OO Ruby objects is stronger now that I have a second way of collaborting a set of information with another set of information. 

It feels a bit nerdy, but I found buliding SQL databases and running queries really fun and rewarding. With so much of the material being difficult to grasp, it feels great when something makes a lot of sense.
