I tend to get that glimmer in my eye - the spark of excitement that fires through every neural pathway in my brain and body - when I see a *new world*. A world of new information, a world of new people finding a weird niche of content to obsess over, a world of possibility that I hadn't been privy to before. It's something that has always driven me to learn new skills, to create new projects, and to figure things out in new ways. Sometimes it's to a fault - it can be a way of diverting when my chosen path becomes too difficult or I find that I'm losing interest. But whether it's "constructive procrastination" or it's a focused and saavy decision, it's always been important to me to follow the idea that sparking my curiousity will always be the strongest motivating force in my life. 

Choosing to start this programming course has it's practical reasons: I would love to find skill-based, higher paying jobs both in New York when I'm home and remote work when I'm on the road for months at a time. But beyond the practical, which never gets me through all the way (see flowery paragraph above), I am interested in this *new world*: one where with some creativity, team work, and a desire to fix what's broken using logic and reasoning, a person can build incredible things that everyone else in the world uses and expects to work automatically. A world that supports each other and fosters new ideas through collaboration and positivity, while so much of the surface cyber world tries to pull each other apart through divisiveness. I am excited to work with Flatiron school for the beginning of this journey because I have quickly realized that the thick, bullet proof cast iron door locking away all the secrets of the Internet is actually wide open. All you have to do is find that spark and say, "Yes, I want to learn" and there will be people waiting on the other side that say, "Welcome. Let's do it".
